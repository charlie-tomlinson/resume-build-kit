# resume-build-kit

An opinionated LaTeX resume class and build setup I use to produce clean, reproducible resumes with minimal friction and no formatting drift.

## Overview

This repository contains a LaTeX resume class. The focus is on keeping resume content readable with centralized formatting decisions.

The code reflects how I prefer to structure intentionally light, focused tools.

## Design goals

- Consistent output across edits
- Content kept separate from formatting logic
- Limited set of macros instead of ad hoc styling
- Low friction editing

## Out of scope

- Resume templates that expose layout, spacing, or styling as user configurable parameters
- Multiple visual variants or themes
- Visual or form based editors
- Installation or onboarding documentation

## Notes

This repository is intentionally light. Most of the behavior is visible directly in the class file.
